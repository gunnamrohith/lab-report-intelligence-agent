Lab Report Intelligence Agent is an AI-powered healthcare application designed to simplify medical laboratory reports for patients. Medical reports often contain complex terminology and numerical values that are difficult for non-medical individuals to understand. This system automatically analyzes lab reports and converts them into clear, structured, and human-friendly health insights.

The goal of this project is to improve health literacy and promote preventive healthcare awareness using intelligent automation.
